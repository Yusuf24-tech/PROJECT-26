Mixed Vegetables: Steamed potatoes, carrots, French beans and green peas make up the bulk of the patty. Garlic, ginger and green chilies (hot peppers) are saut√©ed and then added to the patty mix for an amazing flavor.
Spices: I use Indian spices in this burger recipe to flavor the patties, including coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, red chili powder or cayenne pepper and turmeric powder. These spices combine for a very flavorful patty. You can play around with the combination of these spices and also add your choice of herbs and spices. 
Burger Buns: I used fresh whole wheat burger buns that I got from a local bakery. You can also make homemade burger buns, if you prefer. Since it takes time to make the veggie burger patty itself, I recommend making the buns in advance.
Spiced Mayonnaise Dressing: I used an eggless mayonnaise as the base for the dressing in this burger recipe. For a vegan burger use vegan mayonnaise. Spices, lemon juice, vinegar, oil and a bit of sugar is added to the mayonnaise for a custom dressing that complements the veggie burger perfectly.
